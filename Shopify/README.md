# File Title: ShopifyPBI

This was my 6th project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for Power BI.

### Data
- The excel file provided by TripleTenwas was public data scraped from the Shopify App Store. It includes 7 tables: 
    - ` apps`: Details of the apps on Shopify apps marketplace
    - `apps_categories`: Join tables to connect apps with categories
    - `categories`: Categories of the apps. Each app has multiple categories
    - `reviews`: Each review (row) contains information on user opinion about the related app (rating and comment). Also, it contains the response from the developer if present.

### Description:
