### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 seperate excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 2 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed exel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th 2017 and June 26th 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.

### Description:
- PAGES in Power BI
- Includes LIST HERE
- Purpose was to successfully complete the Zomato onboarding project to showcase analytical skills to the mock company.

### Assumptions:
- The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided five tables (food, menu, orders, restaurant, users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis and there is no need to use all tables provided.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

### Process:
I first learned of the problem presented in it's intirety and it's requirements for approval.
Then I chose software and created my first submission, Decomposition Plan.
After I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards, this was my second submission.
Lastly I presented my findings in a report as my final submission piece.
