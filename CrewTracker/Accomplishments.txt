#Tasks. Project Idea.

CrewTracker Software is redesigning their reporting features and associated user interface.  The Crystal Reports to Microsoft BI Conversion Project will migrate the Crystal Reports from the existing Crystal Reports to Power BI reports and dashboards. There are currently over 170 reports.  Each report contains SQL queries that connect to the CrewTracker database. The task as a group is to migrate and consolidate the reports into Power BI visualizations for ease of user interface (organized and incorporate user interface).

A CrewTracker Software Microsoft SQL Database called “CREWAI” with thousands of anonymized service records has been set up and is available on the Microsoft Azure Cloud.  This will serve as the SQL database used to generate the Microsoft Power BI reports.

Specifically, your tasks are:

- Streamline First Responder Data Management: In this role, leveraged remote desktop access to extract critical reporting components from Crystal Reports, including SQL queries, report layouts, and formula fields. This extracted data was then meticulously cataloged within ClickUp to facilitate efficient project management. Finally, the data files were securely transferred to the Power BI team for further analysis and visualization.
- Conduct Peer Review and Data Validation for Power BI Team: This involved critically assessing the intended purpose and desired outcomes of each assigned report to ensure they aligned with established goals. I then meticulously compared the newly converted data against the source data in Crystal Reports and pre-defined Power BI requirements. Through this data reconciliation process, I identified any inconsistencies or deviations from expected results, along with potential root causes for further investigation. This ensured the accuracy and integrity of the data used for further analysis and visualization by the Power BI team.
- Power BI Team: I focused on enhancing First Responder data by leveraging the capabilities of Power BI. My primary task involved consolidating pre-assigned Crystal Reports into interactive dashboards. These dashboards provided users with a centralized view of key metrics and insights, allowing them to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data.  I also designed user-centric functionalities for sorting, filtering, and managing data fields within reports and dashboards.
- to attend weekly meetings and demonstrate progress and address questions/issues.
- Stay up to date with group chat content and assist peers when able
