# File Title: 2023.11.19.Project4.TB

This was my fourth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for Tableau Visualization.

### Data
- The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
	- `'category'`
   	- `'city'`
   	- `'country/region'`
   	- `'customer ID'`
   	- `'customer name'`
   	- `'order date'`
   	- `'order ID'`
   	- `'postal code'`
   	- `'product ID'`
   	- `'product name'`
   	- `'region'`
   	- `'row ID'`
   	- `'segment'`
   	- `'ship date'`
   	- `'ship mode'`
   	- `'state'`
   	- `'sub-category'`
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item
	- `'order ID'`
   	- `'returned'`

### Description:
- 7 page Tableau Visulization
- Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboard.
- Purpose was to consultant company by reviewing the store’s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

### Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.	
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- Operations department will need to make changes.
- Advertising department needs recommendations.

### Process:
I first joined sheets.
Then I determined profit and loss centers.
Lastly I examined the contribution returns had on profits.

### Findings:
1. Specific sub-categories were thriving or failing in different regions.
2. Some products have a negative profit and should be discontinued.
3. There are some sub-categories that are negative profit and should be discontinued.
4. There are some sub-categories that are high-profit and should get more focus.
5. The best advertising regions have different optimal time periods and budgets.
6. There are several products that have a return rate of 100% and hsould be discontinued.
7. The High-returns need to be investigated to prevent future problems.

### Notes left for Reviewer:
	I hid some sheets that I used for my Dashboard titled “Advertising” as I did not want the client to look at them individually. This one dashboard answers the only question in part 2, as it has multiple answers and I felt this was the best way to visualize that.
